# HawKoin-Ionic
HawKoin is a Mobile application that uses blockchain technology to make life easier for students and faculty at Lehigh University. It is intended for students to ditch their IDs in exchange for a simple mobile application on their smartphone. This replaces purchases made previously through GoldPlus and offers an altenative point of purchase for vendors. Vendors who are registered through Lehigh University will be able to perform transactions with Lehigh Students.

# Users
Users are currently manually given priveleges upon registration, and can occupy 1 of 3 roles: Spender, Vendor, and Admin. Each role has a unique function that manifests itself within the interface upon login. 


## Spender
This can be any student, faculty, or anyone registered under a  Lehigh approved email. Any of these users must be purchasing from a Vendor that supports the HawKoin interface. Those who have access to the Application will be able to make purchases by having a unique QR Code scanned by a Lehigh approved Vendor. 

### How to use

## Vendor
A vendor consists of any Lehigh Approved merchant that sells goods to Lehigh Students. These vendors are intended to be those who sell goods through GoldPlus. Upon login, Vendors will be able to instantly perform transactions by inputting an amount and scanning a Spender's QR Code.

## Admin
Although still in very early stage development, Admins are those within Lehigh that will be able to perform anaylitics on the various transactions completed through the HawKoin App. As of now, these vendors may be able to see limited information about all the transactions performed over time.
